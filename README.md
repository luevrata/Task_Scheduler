# Medical Clinique Application

## Purpose 

To provide clients of a medical clinic with the opportunity to obtain necessary information about the hospital and 
make an appointment  with a doctor without leaving home or phone calling.

## Usage

The users of this application will be the **medical clinique clients**. The clients will have access to the directory 
of doctors, as well as to the calendar of appointments and the ability to schedule or cancel appointments. In addition,
they will be able to see the price of a standard medical examination of doctors of particular speciality.


## Interest

This project is interesting to me since when trying to make an appointment at a medical clinique, I always wanted to 
have such opportunities as:

- Choosing the doctor I will have an appointment with;
- Having a user-friendly interface of possible appointments schedule;
- Being aware of the cost I will pay for the medical examination.

The majority of hospitals could not offer me any of these services, which makes the process of making an appointment 
very inconvenient since the clients do not know what to expect. Therefore, I have decided to make an application coming 
up with the stated problems.

# Task Scheduler

## Purpose 

To provide user convenient application to schedule his tasks for a specific date and time, and view the tasks assigned 
for a specific day.

## Usage

The users of this application will be **busy people**, who want to have an application to manage their tasks in order not to
keep everything they have to do in mind.


## Interest

This project is interesting to me since when studying in university I have lots of deadlines, which are challenging to 
remember. The majority of similar TODO applications do not have such option as scheduling the task on a particular date 
and time, or you are not able to view your tasks at a calendar. Therefore, I have decided to make an application coming
up with the stated problems.
